        Company Resources are all assets a company controls and can use to
        achieve its goals. Company resources include the following:
        <ul>
          <li>-Human Resources</li>
          <li>-Material Resources</li>
          <li>-Financial Resources</li>
          <li>-Intangible Assets</li>
        </ul>
        From this point of view, we can define a company as a unique collection
        of resources. This collection is not easy to replicate, and the
        differences between the quantity, share and quality of resources of
        different companies have an impact on the performance of them. Source:

        If you work at a medium or large company, probably you’ve already heard
        of the term “Human Resources”. Companies usually have a department that
        recruits employees and deals with issues related to people, like paying
        salaries, onboarding, training, etc. In this article, we are not talking
        about the human resources department, but to the people who work for a
        company, and to their skills, knowledge, culture and expertise. Human
        resources play a key role in every company because they have a great
        impact on its performance and the achievement or not of its goals. Human
        resources define company culture and company culture cannot be
        replicated. People not only acquire knowledge and skills by education
        but they also by experience and informal training. Human resources of a
        company have several important features:

        <li>- Skills</li>
        <li>- Experience</li>
        <li>- Qualification</li>
        <li>- Geographic Location</li>
        <li>- Time Availability</li>
